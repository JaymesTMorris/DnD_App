DnD Spell Fx APP
Files:
•	DnDInterface.java - Contains the main method and code to load the FXML file for the initial scene
•	SpellsGUIController.java - The bulk of the program code is found here. This is the main Java file that is "tied" to the FXML document. This contains the methods that are run when buttons are pushed as well as the code to access the API
•	SpellsGUI.fxml - This is the file generated by Scene Builder that contains all of the information for displaying the UI and for linking the UI components to the SpellsGUIController.java file. The classes involved in this hierarchy are AOE.java, Class.java, DC.java, DCType.java, Damage.java, DamageType.java, School.java, Subclass.java
Important Notes:
•	The API is documented in the try statement 
•	Every time we linked it to the GUI, the controller got all messed up and wouldn’t compile
